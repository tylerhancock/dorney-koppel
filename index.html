              <p>Terry and Sandy are both longtime smokers; Terry was the first to be diagnosed with COPD. When she found pulmonary rehabilitation, she was able to get her life and health back on track. </p>
              <p class="pt-3">On pulmonary rehabilitation:</p>
              <p><i>“When I got outta there I was like a new person. I don't have to use my oxygen. I can walk, you know, where I couldn't even do that kinda stuff. Go up and down stairs and all that...”</i></p>
              <p>Later, Sandy also received a diagnosis—and turned to pulmonary rehabilitation. This decision proved a crucial one when a future cancer diagnosis would require surgery on her lungs. She credits the breathing, walking, and movement techniques taught in pulmonary therapy for her smooth post-surgical recovery.</p>
              <p class="pt-3">On getting the word out about COPD:</p>
              <p><i>“You'd be surprised at the people you just talk to on a daily basis that know nothin' about this stuff…there's so many people on a daily basis that have no clue."</i></p>

              <p>Larry spent 35 years working in the coal mines of West Virginia. Growing up, he witnessed the damage mine work did to the lungs of his father and his brothers, but believed that improvements to the mines would be the difference for him. It wasn’t. Today, he combats his condition with an oxygen machine and a regimen of pulmonary rehabilitation.</p>
              <p class="pt-3">On living with COPD:</p>
              <p><i>“You can't do what you'd really want to or what you used to do. I used to do a lot of hunting and I don't even try that any more…I can get a job done but just ten times longer than it used to.”</i></p>
